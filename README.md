# Sugar Level Measurement via Breath using Arduino

## Overview
This project utilizes an **Arduino**, a **gas sensor**, an **SD card adapter**, and a **speaker** to measure sugar levels in a person's breath. Based on the detected sugar level, the system plays an audio alert indicating the level.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, or Nano)
- **Gas Sensor** (e.g., MQ-3 or MQ-135) – detects sugar levels in breath
- **SD Card Adapter** – logs data for further analysis
- **Speaker** – provides an audible alert based on sugar levels
- **Additional components**: Jumper wires, resistors, power supply

## How It Works
1. The user breathes onto the **gas sensor**.
2. The sensor detects the presence of sugar-related gases (such as acetone, often linked to diabetes management).
3. The **Arduino** processes the sensor data and determines the sugar level.
4. The measured value is stored on the **SD card** for logging purposes.
5. Based on predefined thresholds, the **speaker** plays an alert sound indicating whether the sugar level is **low, normal, or high**.

## Alert Levels
- **Low Sugar**: A specific sound plays (e.g., a beep or voice message)
- **Normal Sugar**: A different sound plays
- **High Sugar**: A warning tone or alert message is played

## Setup & Wiring
1. Connect the **gas sensor** to the Arduino's analog input.
2. Attach the **SD card module** to log the data.
3. Connect the **speaker** to an output pin via a simple amplifier circuit.
4. Upload the Arduino code (provided in this repository).

## Future Improvements
- **Improved Calibration**: Fine-tuning the sensor for better accuracy.
- **Mobile Integration**: Sending alerts via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
- **OLED Display**: Showing real-time sugar levels on a screen.
